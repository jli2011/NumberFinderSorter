# NumberFinderSorter
This program presents the user with a list of numbers. The user is then asked to input the number to be found. Once the user inputs the number and selects “find”, the program displays a message indicating the index location of the number. If the user sorts the list and clicks “find” again, the program results change accordingly. The program also allows users to save and open number lists from previous runtime.
